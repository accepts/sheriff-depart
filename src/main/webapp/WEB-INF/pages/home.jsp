    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>View detailed information about a person\car</li>
        <li>Added person\car</li>
        <li>Edit the person\car</li>
        <li>Delete the person\car</li>
        <li>Assign specific persons for corresponding car</li>

    <p style="font-style: italic">
        Twin Peaks is an American television serial drama created by Mark Frost and David Lynch.
        Its pilot episode was broadcast on April 8, 1990 on ABC. Seven more episodes were produced, and the series was
        renewed for a second season that aired until June 10, 1991. Short begining plot:
        In 1989, logger Pete Martell discovers a naked corpse wrapped in plastic on the bank of a river outside the town
        of Twin Peaks, Washington. When Sheriff Harry S. Truman, his deputies, and Dr. Will Hayward arrive, the body is
        identified as homecoming queen Laura Palmer. A badly injured second girl, Ronette Pulaski, is discovered in a
        fugue state.
        FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in to investigate. Cooper's initial examination of Laura's body reveals
        a tiny typed letter "R" inserted under her fingernail. Cooper informs the community that Laura's death matches
        the signature of a killer who murdered another girl in southwestern Washington the previous year, and that
        evidence indicates the killer lives in Twin Peaks.
        The authorities discover that Laura has been living a double life.
